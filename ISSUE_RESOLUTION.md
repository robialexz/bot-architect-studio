# 🔧 Issue Resolution - FlowsyAI Landing Page Enhancement

## 🚨 Problem Identified
**Error:** `ReferenceError: UltraWowHeroSection is not defined`

**Root Cause:** During the landing page enhancement, I updated the imports and component usage in `Index.tsx` but left references to old components in the component availability check section.

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Component Reference Error**
**Problem:** 
- `UltraWowHeroSection` was referenced in the component availability check but was no longer imported
- `EnhancedWaitlistCTA` was referenced but not imported

**Solution:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (causing error)
const components = {
  PipelineCanvas,
  UltraWowHeroSection,  // ❌ Not imported
  DemoVideoSection,
  UltraSocialProofSection,
  TokenomicsSection,
  EnhancedWaitlistCTA,  // ❌ Not imported
};

// AFTER (fixed)
const components = {
  PipelineCanvas,
  EnhancedHeroSection,     // ✅ Correctly imported
  EnhancedFeaturesSection, // ✅ Correctly imported
  EnhancedStatsSection,    // ✅ Correctly imported
  EnhancedCTASection,      // ✅ Correctly imported
  DemoVideoSection,
  UltraSocialProofSection,
  TokenomicsSection,
};
```

### 2. **Component Export Issues**
**Problem:** 
- `EnhancedHeroSection` was using `export default function` syntax instead of proper React component export

**Solution:**
```typescript
// BEFORE
export default function EnhancedHeroSection() {
  // component code
}

// AFTER
const EnhancedHeroSection: React.FC = () => {
  // component code
};

export default EnhancedHeroSection;
```

### 3. **CSS Import Order Issue**
**Problem:** 
- CSS imports were placed after Tailwind imports, causing build warnings

**Solution:**
```css
/* BEFORE */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
@import './styles/animations.css';  /* ❌ After Tailwind */

/* AFTER */
@import './styles/animations.css';  /* ✅ Before Tailwind */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```
