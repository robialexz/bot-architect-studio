// ===== PROJECT: AI Workflow Node Visualization =====
// Source: External design reference image
// Description: Interactive node-based workflow visualization showing AI agent connections
// Key Features:
// - Node-based workflow layout with connecting lines
// - Different node types (forms, AI agents, integrations, decision points)
// - Curved connection lines with directional flow
// - Dark theme with subtle gradients
// - Role-based sections at top (IT Ops, Sec Ops, Dev Ops, Sales, You)
// - Interactive elements with hover states
// - Professional card-based layout
// Tech: Appears to be React-based with custom SVG connections

- Rounded corner container with border

Node Types Identified:
1. Form nodes (rectangular with icons)
2. AI Agent nodes (central, prominent)
3. Integration nodes (service logos)
4. Decision nodes (diamond/circular shapes)
5. Action nodes (rectangular with specific actions)

Connection System:
- Curved SVG paths between nodes
- Directional flow indicators
- Dashed lines for some connections
- Different line styles for different connection types

Color Scheme:
