selected early access users from our waitlist.

**Q: What are the system requirements for FlowsyAI?** A: FlowsyAI runs in modern
web browsers and requires no special software installation. For AR features,
you'll need a mobile device with camera access and AR capabilities (iOS 12+ or
Android 7.0+).

**Q: How does the AR workflow builder work?** A: The AR interface uses your
mobile device's camera to create a 3D workspace where you can build workflows in
spatial environment. Simply point your camera at a flat surface and start
building workflows with gesture controls.

#### Token & Pricing

**Q: When will the FlowsyAI token be launched?** A: The FlowsyAI token is
scheduled to launch in **July 2025**. Early waitlist members will receive

through our token burn mechanism.

**Q: How does the token burn mechanism work?** A: After the official platform

months to ensure project commitment. The token smart contract will be audited by
leading security firms before launch, and we maintain full transparency in our
